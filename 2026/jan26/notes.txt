TODOS:
- sufficient conditions for a power law in psi given we know that the q(tau | r) propagator of exit time conditioned on fixed radius should follow that for a bessel process (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07551)
- need to better understand technical details of ergodicity breaking and the Tauberian theorems
- combine this week's work with last:
    - more expliticly note that we are conditioning on the radius size in the exit time density
    - relate U density from last week to psi and phi so their characteristic functions can be calculated
