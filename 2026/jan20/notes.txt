Administrative:
- contact Krystyna regarding if chairs can be swapped before committee meeting?
	- ask Claudiu to make sure everything is a-okay in this regard

Research:
- currently believe that the conditioning on certain trajectories results in circular reasoning (get "confinement" if you condition on it)
- paper (Near-Critical Fluctuations and Cytoskeleton-Assisted Phase Separation Lead to Subdiffusion in Cell Membranes, Fig. 2) seems to demonstrate that the slow diffusion lipids collect near the boundaries themselves and in the smaller regions => some correlation between parameters of the model
- consider integral over space for Robin BC directly
- is ell the only place that kappa joins the final density in?
- check limiting behaviour compared to 2014 result
	- check their calculation in two dimensions and look at exponents
	- can we make a distinction between no cytoskeleton and some? lipid raft size?
