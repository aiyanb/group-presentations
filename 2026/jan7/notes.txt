Research outlook: 
- currently two perspectives on membrane protein models. interactions + fixed density (spin model) and non-fixed density w/ no interactions (stochastic) 
    - how can these be merged?

Administrative TODOs:
- complete application for BSS2026
- ask Xiaohan/ Claudiu about ensemble-averaged MSD behaviour
- Meetings now on Fridays @10:30AM instead of Wednesdays

Research TODOs:
- Is there an exact solution to the 1D heat equation with Robin/ generalized leather BC?
- Is there any way to make the CTRW coarse graining idea feasible in dimensions >1?
- Can the ideas of Massignan et al 2014 (doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.150603) be combined with Grebenkov 2020 (doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.078102) to give an idea about the behaviour of MSD for reflective models?
    - compute lowest order mode of spectral expansion for non-trivial geometries
    - improve 2014 model by starting from edge. can view as an annealed CTRW?

Additional notes:
- presentation statement of conditional independence is incorrect unless there is a symmetry in the domains, which is generally broken in 2D for finite sized regions (same for diffusivity vs permissivity asymmetry)
