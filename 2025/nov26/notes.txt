- Barriers due to actin skeleton by themselves not sufficient for non-Lebesgue steady state

- Four current models:
    1. Motion just determined by diffusivity (see November 19 presentation) but did not consider a steep enough diffusivity field; lipid rafts have much starker
    2. Diffusivity + interaction between receptors sufficient to drive localization to lower diffusivity regions?
    3. Correlations between the barriers and actin barriers sufficient to drive localization?
        - Can we use random tessellations/ stochastic geometry to understand these systems? Area drawn from, say, power-law distribution
    4. Non-equilibrium source/ sink of receptors leads to localization in lower diffusivity/ "confined" domains
