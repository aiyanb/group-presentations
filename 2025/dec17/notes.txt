- probability density funciton
- can you solve using as a CTMW on the discrete states? spectral analysis?
- reduce the problem to a system of two equations analytically?

Ideas related to random barrier model and its applications:
- simulate lipid phase sep with variable barrier heights
- how does the "natural variation of density" of pickets lead to a variation in the hopping rate?
- fixed density and fixed size
