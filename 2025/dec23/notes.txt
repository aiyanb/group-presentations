- should barrirs be interpretted as staying at the point with rate lambda or hopping to the left?
    - double check that I get similar behaviour in this case?
- double check continuum limit slide 2 for delta function
- go through Kay-Giuggulio derivation again for our new functional form
- consider periodic BC agin with initial position sampled from stationary distribution
- correspondence between MSD computed via first-passage time density approach and continuum model: 
  misses short-timescale due to approximations
- Steps for computing the first passage time density:
    1. Density from an arbitrary initial position to the edge
    2. From one edge to the other
    3. Recurring to the edge
- Can non-power law behaviour give rise to power law domain FPT density?
- coarse-grained process is non-Markovian?
